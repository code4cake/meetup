# Let's take a look

<Notes>If you have framer installed feel free to open it now and just create an empty project or just follow along by watching</Notes>

# So we briefly saw what Framer is all about. 

<Notes>Now let's discuss what's new on Framer</Notes>

# What's New on Framer X 🤩

<Appear>
  <li>A wonderful API giving us a better way to customize and control animations and events</li>
  <li>A massive update on their docs, which you can find here</li>
  <li>https://www.framer.com/api</li>
  <li>As well as various resources both paying an free</li>
  <li>Which you can find here...</li>
  <li>https://www.framer.com/tutorials/</li>
</Appear>

<Notes>I won't go into details explaining their API, given that this would go beyond the scope of these 2hours, but I'll go through some basics of  their Animation and Event API as I go through the prototypes.</Notes>
<Notes>I have put a list of resources and links on the repo.</Notes>

# Animations

<Notes>We have discuss what new on Framer and got acquainted with the tool now let's explore the animations</Notes>

---

# Framer gives me some basic tools to animate my designs

---

# Animating Designs

<Appear>
  <li>👉 Linking or Links</li>
  <li>👉 Page Frames</li>
  <li>👉 Scroll Frames</li>
</Appear>

<Note>I will briefly go into what each one of them is and then we will see them in action</Note>

--- 

# Let's Discuss Linking (or Links) 📄 ➡ 📄

---

# The linking functionality links a component or frame to another frame

<Notes>It' gives me.</Notes>

<Appear>
  <li>👉 Transition Effect </li>
  <li>👉 Direction</li>
</Appear>

<Notes>It's simple but it could be quite powerful for just specifying things like modals, overlays, basic swiping</Notes>

---

# The Page Frame 📃 → (📃 + 📃 + 📃)

---

# "Pages" are like "Links" but on Steroids 🏋️‍

<Notes>It's a frame component that can link multiple screens.</Notes>
<Notes>It comes with already prepacked goodies</Notes>

---

# Pages (cont..)

<Notes>Right from the tools panel I could specify..</Notes>

<Appear>
  <li>👉 Direction </li>
  <li>👉 Gap between Pages</li>
  <li>👉 Effect (Transition) </li>
  <li>👉 The Momentum (mass * velocity) of the effect </li>
  <li>👉 ...etc </li>
</Appear>

---

<Notes>Let's see some prototypes of this.</Notes>

# Onto the prototypes...

---

# More "advanced" Animations

<Notes>I say advance, but they are not advance, what they do require though is some basic knowledge of JS concepts</Notes>
<Notes>So let's discuss these</Notes>

# What's a variable ?
