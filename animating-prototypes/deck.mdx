  <li>What's new in Framer X</li>
  <li>Simple Animations using Linking, and Page functionality</li>
  <li>Customized Animations using Overrides and the Data Object</li>

# Agenda for today (cont..)

<Appear>
  <li>Brief introduction of some Javascript terms...</li>
  <li>don't worry just enough to be dangerous 👩‍🎤</li>
  <li>Some food, cause we need to eat 🍕 + 🍻 + 🥤 </li>
  <li>Q&A</li>
  <li>Some Live Coding or an exercise to take home</li>
</Appear>

---

# On Github...

<Notes>Remember that on on github you'll find</Notes>

<Appear>
  <li>👉 all slides</li>
  <li>👉 as well as the prototypes</li>
  <li>👉 github.com/dantesolis/meetup/animating-prototypes</li>
</Appear>

---

# But before we begin 

<Notes>let's give a round of applause at the folks of JobYourself for hosting the event</Notes>

---

# And...

<Appear>
  <h1>also another round of applause 👏👏👏 for you folks...</h1>
</Appear>

<Notes>It is not always easy to make it to one of this events after spending all day at work</Notes>

---

# So what's Framer ?

---

# Framer is a interactive tool where you can quickly create prototypes

<Notes>You can do this by either</Notes>

<Appear>
  <li>Designing</li>
  <li>Coding (React. JS)</li>
  <li>Or Both</li>
</Appear>

---

# In short 

<Appear>
  <h1>I think of framer of a combination of Sketch, Invision and CodeSanbox</h1>
</Appear>

---

# Framer is divided into various panels...

<Appear>
  <li>Tools Panel</li>
  <li>Layers Panel</li>
  <li>Components Panel</li>
  <li>Code Panel or Playground</li>
  <li>Store</li>
  <li>the Team Store</li>
  <li>and the Preview Panel where you can preview your prototypes</li>
</Appear>

<Notes>Where you create your prototypes</Notes>
<Notes>Where you see all your layers or frames</Notes>
<Notes>Where you see all created components and where you can create new components</Notes>
<Notes>Where you code your Overrides, extend co mponents, etc</Notes>
<Notes>Where you can search and install public available components made by other people or the components you have published</Notes>
<Notes>A Private Store for your Team</Notes>

---

# Let's take a look

<Notes>If you have framer installed feel free to open it now and just create an empty project or just follow along by watching</Notes>

---

# So we briefly saw what Framer is all about. 

<Notes>Now let's discuss what's new on Framer</Notes>

---

# What's New on Framer X 🤩

<Appear>
  <li>A wonderful API giving us a better way to customize and control animations and events</li>
  <li>A massive update on their docs, which you can find...</li>
  <li>https://www.framer.com/api</li>
  <li>As well as various resources both paying an free</li>
  <li>Which you can find...</li>
  <li>https://www.framer.com/tutorials/</li>
</Appear>

<Notes>I won't go into details explaining their API, given that this would go beyond the scope of these 2hours, but I'll go through some basics of  their Animation and Event API as I go through the prototypes.</Notes>
<Notes>I have put a list of resources and links on the repo.</Notes>

---

# Animations

<Notes>We have discuss what new on Framer and got acquainted with the tool now let's explore the animations</Notes>

---

# Framer gives me some basic tools to animate my designs

---

# Animating Designs

<Appear>
  <li>👉 Linking or Links</li>
  <li>👉 Page Frames</li>
  <li>👉 Scroll Frames</li>
</Appear>

<Notes>I will briefly go into what each one of them is and then we will see them in action in an actual prototype</Notes>

--- 

# Let's Discuss Linking (or Links) 📄 ➡ 📄

---

# The linking functionality links a component or frame to another frame

<Notes>It' gives me.</Notes>

<Appear>
  <li>👉 Transition Effect </li>
  <li>👉 Direction</li>
</Appear>

<Notes>It's simple but it could be quite powerful for just specifying things like modals, overlays, basic swiping. I can control transitions, and direction</Notes>

---

# The Page Frame 📃 → (📃 + 📃 + 📃)

---

# "Pages" are like "Links" but on Steroids 🏋️‍

<Notes>It's a frame component that can link multiple screens.</Notes>
<Notes>It comes with already prepacked goodies</Notes>

---

# Pages (cont..)

<Notes>Right from the tools panel I could specify..</Notes>

<Appear>
  <li>👉 Direction </li>
  <li>👉 Gap between Pages</li>
  <li>👉 Effect (Transition) </li>
  <li>👉 The Momentum (mass * velocity) of the effect </li>
  <li>👉 ...etc </li>
</Appear>

---

<Notes>Let's see some prototypes of this.</Notes>

# Onto the prototypes...

---

# More "advanced" Animations

<Notes>I say advance, but they are not advance, what they do require though is some basic knowledge of JS concepts. So let's discuss what these are. Would you guys like to take a break here to eat something or should? </Notes>

---

# Some Javascript (Coding) lingo before we begin...

<Notes>I will go through all the slides in this section before jumping into more concrete details..</Notes>

---

# What's a Variable ?

<Notes>A variable is simple a way to store some value</Notes>

---

# <Image src='./images/variable-image.png' size="50%" />

<Notes>If you remember anything from elementary school it looks something like this.</Notes>

---

# What's an Object ?

<Notes>Who's has gone to IKEA? Well this is an Object.</Notes>

---

# <Image src='./images/chair-jokkmokk.jpg' size='50%' />

---

# What's an Array ?

<Notes>An Array is s type of object, it just allows me to properly index some items. Think of it like a bookshelve, where the books are the items on that shelve. Or a box of donuts...</Notes>

---

#  <Image src='./images/donut-array.png' size='50%' />

---

# What's a Function ?

<Notes>They respond to: "Do this" or "I take some input and return something else". Functions are just set of instructions. Framer gives me the Override function, which it does just that. Override.</Notes>

<Appear>
   <h1>Do this..</h1>
   <h1>or take this and output this</h1>
</Appear>

---

# What's TypeScript ?

<Notes>For all intents and purposes of tonight, we are gonna treat typescript as just documentation for your code. It does much more than that, but in the simplest form it does this very well. It documents the code you write so others can utilise it better.</Notes>

---
 
# Let See Now some Code Explaining those terms

<Notes>And from here we'll transition into the actual prototypes explaining simple overrides, more complex overrides and a live code example.</Notes>

---

# Q & A ❓ 😃 ❓

---

# The End

---

# You can find me on Github

<Appear>
  <li>https:github.com/dantesolis</li>
  <li>or on Twitter @dsbrux</li>
</Appear>

<Notes>Tonight was the last meetup before the Summer break, but there will be another one last Tuesday of October.</Notes>
